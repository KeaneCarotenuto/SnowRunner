## SnowRunner : Privacy Policy

This is a small mobile game app made for a university assignment; the app is also available on Google Play.

I have not programmed this app to collect any personally identifiable information.
Unity Adverts are used to provide and display adverts in the game, users may opt out of the data collection by pressing the “ℹ” button on the adverts, this will delete the data Unity has stored on you, and will stop logging any data.
Please read here for more info, as things may change: https://unity.com/legal/privacy-policy

If you find any security vulnerability that has been inadvertently caused by me, or have any question regarding how the app protectes your privacy, please send me an email and I will surely try to fix it/help you.
